# SmartAppt — Appointment Management System

**SmartAppt** is a modular appointment-booking system built for the Digitain Academy program.
The project uses **C#, ASP.NET 8, and ADO.NET with SQL Server** (MSSQL), relying on stored procedures for all database operations.

The system follows a strict **layered architecture**, keeping every concern cleanly separated and maintainable:

## Overview

- **API Layer** — ASP.NET 8 Web API
- **Business Layer** — core logic, service rules for business and customer
- **Data Layer** — repositories, data access via ADO.NET, stored procedures
- **Common Layer** — shared utilities, libraries

This structure ensures a predictable flow: API → Business → Data, with zero cross-contamination between layers.
